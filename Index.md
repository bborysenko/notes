I'm Borys, and you've stumbled upon my personal notes on various topics like DevOps, SRE, software engineering, management, and more. These notes are primarily for my own understanding and may not be perfectly organized or polished. Consider it as a way for me to share what I'm learning with others.

If you notice any errors, please let me know. I may not be able to respond immediately, but I appreciate any criticism or suggestions you have.
